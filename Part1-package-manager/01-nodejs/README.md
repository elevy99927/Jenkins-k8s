# Node.js Labs

## Overview

This folder focuses on learning and practicing Node.js, a popular JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js is widely used for building scalable network applications and is a foundational tool in modern web development.

In this section, you will:

- Understand the basics of Node.js.
- Learn how to use Node.js modules and package management with npm.
- Practice building and running Node.js applications through two hands-on labs.
