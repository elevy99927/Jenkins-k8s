# DevOps Training in CI/CD Repository

This repository is a structured guide for hands-on training in DevOps practices, with a focus on CI/CD pipelines. It is divided into several parts, each covering essential tools and methodologies for modern software development and deployment workflows.

## Structure of the Repository

### **Part 1: Maven, Gradle, Node, and Python**
- **Objective**: Introduction to popular build tools and programming languages for CI/CD.
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Maven and Gradle configuration and usage for Java projects.
  - Setting up and running Node.js projects.
  - Python virtual environments and dependency management.
- **Hands-on Labs**:
  - Writing and testing `pom.xml` and `build.gradle` configurations.
  - Setting up package.json for Node.js projects.
  - Using Python with `requirments.txt`, `venv` and `anconda` .

### **Part 2: Repositories and Artifactory**
- **Objective**: Understanding the importance of repositories and artifact management.
- **Topics Covered**:
  - JFrog Artifactory installation and configuration.
  - Nexus Repository Manager for managing dependencies.
  - Creating and managing Docker, Helm, and generic repositories.
- **Hands-on Labs**:
  - Setting up remote, local, and virtual repositories.
  - Uploading and downloading artifacts.
  - Integration of repositories with CI/CD pipelines.

### **Part 3: Testing and Quality Assurance** 
- **Objective**: Introducing tools and techniques for automating testing and quality assurance in CI/CD.
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Static code analysis tools like SonarQube or ESLint.
  - Writing and running unit tests using JUnit (Java), pytest (Python), and Jest (Node.js).
  - Integrating testing frameworks into CI/CD pipelines.
  - Automated security scans using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check or Trivy.
- **Hands-on Labs**:
  - Adding static code analysis to existing Maven, Gradle, or Node projects.
  - Writing unit tests for Python, Node.js, or Java applications.
  - Integrating quality checks into Jenkins or CircleCI pipelines.

### **Part 4: Building CI/CD Pipelines**
- **Objective**: Designing and implementing CI/CD pipelines for automation.
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Jenkins, CircleCI, and GitHub Actions workflows.
  - Branch management and merging strategies.
  - Multi-environment deployment pipelines (e.g., staging, production).
- **Hands-on Labs**:
  - Creating Jenkinsfiles, CircleCI `.yml` configurations, and GitHub Actions workflows.
  - Automating deployments to Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.
  - Managing secrets and environment variables.

### **Part 5: TBD - AWS and IAC**
