# **Repositories and Artifacts: A Practical Guide**

This guide introduces the concepts of **repositories** and **artifacts**, provides an overview of their types, and explains three exercises to set up and manage repositories using popular tools: **JFrog JCR**, **Nexus Repository**, and **Helm Charts**. Each exercise will have its dedicated README for setup and usage instructions.

---

## **What is a Repository?**
A repository is a storage location where artifacts (binary files, configuration files, and packages) are stored, versioned, and managed. It acts as a centralized hub for organizing and distributing software components in a development lifecycle.

### **Types of Repositories**
1. **Local Repositories**:
   - Hosted on a local server.
   - Used for private development and distribution within a team or organization.

2. **Remote Repositories**:
   - Proxy for external repositories (e.g., Maven Central, PyPI, npm registry).
   - Caches dependencies locally to reduce latency and ensure reliability.

3. **Virtual Repositories**:
   - Aggregates multiple repositories (local or remote) into a single logical endpoint.
   - Simplifies management and access.

---

## **What is an Artifact?**
Artifacts are files generated during a build process or necessary for deploying an application. They include:
- Binary files (e.g., `.jar`, `.war`, `.exe`)
- Container images (e.g., Docker images)
- Helm charts
- Configuration files
- Dependency packages (e.g., npm modules, PyPI packages)

Artifacts are version-controlled and stored in repositories for easy retrieval and deployment.

## **Exercises**

### **1. JFrog JCR (Jfrog Container Registry)**
- **Objective**: Set up JFrog's free version of Artifactory Container Registry using Docker Compose.
- **Repository Types Supported**:
  - Docker images
  - Maven, npm, PyPI, and more
- **Why JFrog?**:
  - Robust artifact management with support for multiple package types.
  - Granular permissions and flexible repository configurations.

ðŸ“˜ **See**: [Exercise 1 README: JFrog JCR](exercise1-jfrog-jcr/README.md)

---

### **2. Nexus Repository (Free Version)**
- **Objective**: Deploy Nexus Repository OSS (Open Source Version) using Docker Compose.
- **Repository Types Supported**:
  - Docker images
  - Maven, npm, PyPI, RubyGems, and more
- **Why Nexus?**:
  - Scalable and versatile for artifact storage and proxying.
  - Free and open-source with a strong developer community.

ðŸ“˜ **See**: [Exercise 2 README: Nexus Repository](exercise2-nexus-repository/README.md)

---

### **3. Helm Charts**
- **Objective**: Learn to manage Kubernetes applications using Helm Charts.
- **Artifact Type**:
  - Helm charts (packaged Kubernetes application configurations).
- **Why Helm Charts?**:
  - Simplifies Kubernetes application deployment and versioning.
  - Allows for reusability and parameterization of Kubernetes configurations.

## **Prerequisites for All Exercises**
1. **Docker**:
   Install Docker on your machine:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install docker.io -y
   ```

2. **Docker Compose**:
   Install Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install docker-compose -y
   ```

3. **Git**:
   Clone this repository to access all exercise files:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/repositories-and-artifacts.git
   cd repositories-and-artifacts
   ```
---

## **How to Get Started**
1. Navigate to the specific exercise directory.
2. Follow the instructions in the README for that exercise.

---

## **Next Steps**
- Proceed with [Exercise 1: JFrog JCR](exercise1-jfrog-jcr/README.md).
- Experiment with the different tools and understand their unique features.
- Use these tools to improve your CI/CD workflows and artifact management processes.
