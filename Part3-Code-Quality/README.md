### **Part 3: (TBD) Testing and Quality Assurance**
#### Overview
This section focuses on integrating automated testing and quality assurance into the CI/CD pipeline. It aims to ensure that applications meet quality standards before being deployed.

#### Topics Covered (TBD)
- Static code analysis tools to identify code smells and vulnerabilities.
- Writing and running unit tests for various programming languages.
- Automating security scans.
- Configuring quality gates and testing thresholds.

#### Labs
1. **Static Code Analysis**:
   - Integrate SonarQube with Maven/Gradle projects.
   - Run ESLint on a Node.js project.
2. **Unit Testing**:
   - Write JUnit tests for a Java application.
   - Use pytest for Python.
   - Run Jest tests for a Node.js application.
3. **Security Scanning**:
   - Perform dependency scanning using OWASP Dependency-Check.
   - Use Trivy to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.
