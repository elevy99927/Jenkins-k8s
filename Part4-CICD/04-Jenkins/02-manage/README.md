## Configuration as Code
Reload your configuration or update configuration source.
Manage Jenkins configuration through YAML files instead of manual UI configuration.
Enable version control and automated deployment of Jenkins settings.

**Configuration as Code (JCasC)** allows you to define your entire Jenkins configuration in YAML files, replacing manual UI configuration with code-based management.

**Benefits:**
- **Version Control**: Store configuration in Git for tracking changes
- **Automation**: Automatically apply configuration on Jenkins startup
- **Consistency**: Ensure identical configuration across environments
- **Recovery**: Quickly restore Jenkins with the same configuration

**Example jenkins.yaml:**
```yaml
jenkins:
  systemMessage: "Jenkins configured automatically by JCasC"
  numExecutors: 2
  
  securityRealm:
    local:
      allowsSignup: false
      users:
       - id: "admin"
         password: "admin123"

  authorizationStrategy:
    globalMatrix:
      permissions:
        - "Overall/Administer:admin"
        - "Overall/Read:authenticated"

unclassified:
  location:
    url: "http://jenkins.example.com/"
    adminAddress: "admin@example.com"
```

### Clouds
Add, remove, and configure cloud instances to provision agents on-demand.
Set up dynamic agent provisioning with Kubernetes, Docker, or cloud providers.
Configure auto-scaling policies to optimize resource usage and costs.

## Appearance
Configure the look and feel of Jenkins.
Customize themes, logos, and UI elements to match your organization's branding.
Set up custom CSS and JavaScript for advanced UI modifications.
